### StarMADWMY_06
<details>
<summary>Bubble Loop Skip</summary>
 
This strat skips the second loop around in the dream bubble at the end of the room. \
First, start by updashing at this spring.  By not extending the wavedash on the previous platform, this input can be made into a buffer. \

Then, choose one of two ways to get into the bubble.  The cornerjump is about 1 second faster but much more difficult. \

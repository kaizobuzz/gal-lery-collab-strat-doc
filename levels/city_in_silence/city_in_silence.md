Try to enter the dreamblock on the left side and buffer the jump for the demohyper on the block, might make it more consistent? \

For the final jumps, starting with frame one being the first buffered jump out of the dream block \
frame 1: buffered dream jump \
frame 2: double dream jump \
frame 3: hold jump \
frame 4-until besides the block to coost off of: release jump \
Then, 1f jump for the coost and hold down for a slight bit to not collide with the top spinner.
